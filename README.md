# Static-Site-Builder
A tool that utilizes markdown files as content and turns them into static websites. Simple to a solution like HUGO. This project was meant to practice my understanding of OOP, fuctional programming and a bit of recursion. 


## How to use
1. Download repo
2. Add your markdown files that you will be using to create your pages to the "content" directory. If you require multiple pages create a sub-directory for each page and place the desired within that directory. Make sure that all markdown files have the name 'index.md'
3. Add any supplemental files such as images and css files to the static directory
4. Update the template.html file with your desired template.
5. Run main.sh script
